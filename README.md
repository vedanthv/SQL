1. **WHERE Clause**:<br>
Show population of Germany<br>
`SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Germany'`

2. **IN Clause** :
Checking a list The word IN allows us to check if an item is in a list<br>
`SELECT name, population FROM world
  WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');`

3. **Between Clause**:<br>
Which countries are not too small and not too big? BETWEEN allows range checking (range specified is inclusive of boundary values).<br>
`SELECT name, area FROM world
  WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000`

## 2. SELECT FROM WORLD
<hr>

### Sample Select Statement

`SELECT name, continent, population FROM world`

### Large Countries

`SELECT name FROM world
WHERE population > 200000000`

### per capita gdp

Give the name and the per capita GDP for those countries with a population of at least 200 million.

`SELECT name, gdp/population
FROM world 
WHERE population > 200000000`

### South America In millions

Show the name and population in millions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Divide the population by 1000000 to get population in millions.

`select name, population/1000000
from world 
where continent = 'South America'`

### France, Germany, Italy

`select name,population 
from world
where name in ('France','Germany','Italy')`

### United

Show the countries which have a name that includes the word 'United'

`select name
from world 
where name like '%United%'`

### Two ways to be big

Two ways to be big: A country is big if it has an area of more than 3 million sq km or it has a population of more than 250 million.

Show the countries that are big by area or big by population. Show name, population and area.

`select name,population, area
from world
where area > 3000000 or population > 250000000`

### One or the other (but not both)

Exclusive OR (XOR). Show the countries that are big by area (more than 3 million) or big by population (more than 250 million) but not both. Show name, population and area.

`select name, population, area 
from world
where area > 3000000 xor population > 250000000`

### Rounding

Show the name and population in millions and the GDP in billions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Use the ROUND function to show the values to two decimal places.

`select name, ROUND(population/1000000,2), ROUND(gdp/1000000000, 2)
from world
where continent = 'South America'`

### Trillion dollar economies

Show the name and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of at least one trillion (1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). Round this value to the nearest 1000.

Show per-capita GDP for the trillion dollar countries to the nearest $1000.

`SELECT name, ROUND(gdp/population, -3)
FROM world
WHERE gdp > 1000000000000;`

### Name and capital have the same length

Greece has capital Athens.

Each of the strings 'Greece', and 'Athens' has 6 characters.

Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same number of characters.

`SELECT name, capital
FROM world
WHERE LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital)`

### âš  Matching name and capital

The capital of Sweden is Stockholm. Both words start with the letter 'S'.

Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word.
You can use the function LEFT to isolate the first character.

`SELECT name, capital
FROM world
WHERE LEFT(name,1) = LEFT(capital,1) 
AND name != capital;`

You can use <> as the NOT EQUALS operator.

### All the vowels

Find the country that has all the vowels and no spaces in its name.

You can use the phrase name NOT LIKE '%a%' to exclude characters from your results.
The query shown misses countries like Bahamas and Belarus because they contain at least one 'a'

```
SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE name LIKE '%a%' 
AND name LIKE '%e%' 
AND name LIKE '%i%' 
AND name LIKE '%o%' 
AND name LIKE '%u%' 
AND name NOT LIKE '% %';
```
## 3. Pattern Matching Strings

### Find the country that start with Y

```
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE 'Y%'
```

### Find the country that end with Y

```
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE '%Y'
 ```
### Luxembourg has an x - so does one other country. List them both.

```
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE '%x%'
```

### Iceland, Switzerland end with land - but are there others?

```
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE '%land'
```

### Columbia starts with a C and ends with ia - there are two more like this.

```
SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE name LIKE 'C%' AND name LIKE '%ia'
```
