I've compiled the solutions to all of all 10 levels on the [SQL Zoo Tutorial](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).  


## SELECT basics
Simple queries to get started.

SELECT name, population FROM world
  WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark');
```

3. Just the right size

```sql
SELECT name, area FROM world
  WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000
  ```

## SELECT from WORLD Tutorial

In this tutorial you will use the SELECT command on the table world:

1. Introduction

```sql
SELECT name, continent, population 
    FROM world
```

2. Large Countries
Show the name for the countries that have a population of at least 200 million. 200 million is 200000000, there are eight zeros.

```sql
SELECT name FROM world
    WHERE population > 200000000
```
3. Per capita GDP
Give the name and the per capita GDP for those countries with a population of at least 200 million.

```sql
SELECT name, gdp/population
FROM world 
WHERE population > 200000000
```
4. South America In millions
Show the name and population in millions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Divide the population by 1000000 to get population in millions.

```sql
select name, population/1000000
from world 
where continent = 'South America'
```

5. Show the name and population for France, Germany, Italy

```sql
select name,population 
from world
where name in ('France','Germany','Italy')
```

6. United
Show the countries which have a name that includes the word 'United'

```sql
select name
from world 
where name like '%United%'
```

7. Two ways to be big: A country is big if it has an area of more than 3 million sq km or it has a population of more than 250 million.
Show the countries that are big by area or big by population. Show name, population and area.

```sql
select name,population, area
from world
where area > 3000000 or population > 250000000
```

8. Show the countries that are big by area (more than 3 million) or big by population (more than 250 million) but not both. Show name, population and area.

```sql
select name, population, area 
from world
where area > 3000000 xor population > 250000000
```
9. Rounding
For South America show population in millions and GDP in billions both to 2 decimal places.

```sql
select name, ROUND(population/1000000,2), ROUND(gdp/1000000000, 2)
from world
where continent = 'South America'
```

10. Trillion dollar economies[Important]
Show the name and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of at least one trillion (1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). Round this value to the nearest 1000.
**Show per-capita GDP for the trillion dollar countries to the nearest $1000.**

```sql
SELECT name, ROUND(gdp/population, -3)
FROM world
WHERE gdp > 1000000000000;
```

11. Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same number of characters.

```sql
SELECT name, capital
FROM world
WHERE LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital)
```

12. Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word.

```sql
SELECT name, capital
